# ParseDispelResists

Scrapes a World of Warcraft combat log folder for dispels and dispel resists of debuffs cast by level 83 bosses. Generates a histogram showing how many dispels succeeded and failed at various amounts of hit rating.

Even for dispellers who wore 0-1% spell hit, only `5 / 728 = 0.69%` resisted. If the resist chance was based on the debuff caster's level, we would have expected to see 17% of dispels resist.
